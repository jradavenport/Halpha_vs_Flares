\begin{abstract}
results from our automated survey of stellar flares using the entire Kepler dataset. Matching our flare stars to Kepler rotation periods, we find a decline in the energy emitted in flares as stars spin down. For a subset of Kepler M dwarfs with low resolution followup spectra, we also find a correlation between Halpha luminosity and the energy emitted in flares. These two results give the first definitive evidence of flare rates declining over stellar time, indicating flares are intimately connected to age--rotation--activity evolution of the global stellar dynamo.

\section{Discussion}

this is the first time a direct connection between stellar flare energy and other traditional magnetic activity indicators has been determined, tying the occurrence of flares on small size scales to the total chromospheric activity of the star.
