# Halpha versus Flares

This repo contains work-in-progress on an investigation of the correlation between the total energy emitted in M dwarf flares and the Halpha line. Here Halpha is coming from low resolution spectroscopy from LAMOST and follow-up data from APO DIS. Flare energy is calculated using preliminary results from [appaloosa](https://github.com/jradavenport/appaloosa).
